# 👋 Hey, I'm Eddy 

🎓 I'm a passionate IT student from Marseille, currently pursuing a **Bachelor in Systems & Network Administration** at CESI Aix-en-Provence.  
💻 I hold a **BTS SIO – SISR** diploma (Infrastructure & Networks), and I'm **CCNA certified**, with a strong focus on **Linux, services deployment, scripting**, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## 💡 What I Do

I enjoy building real-life IT environments from scratch — mixing Linux, Windows, networking, automation, and monitoring tools.

Recently, I designed and deployed a full **virtual infrastructure** 

- ✅ **Active Directory + DNS + DHCP**
- ✅ **Nextcloud** with LDAP integration for collaboration
- ✅ **GLPI** for asset & incident management
- ✅ **hMailServer + Thunderbird** for internal mail
- ✅ **Apache, MariaDB, SSH, RDP, IIS**
- ✅ Proper **VLAN segmentation**, IP plans, and remote access
- ✅ Network analysis with **Wireshark**

💡 Fully documented, partially automated — with plans for backup, HTTPS, and monitoring via Zabbix.
